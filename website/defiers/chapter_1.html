    <h1>Chapter 1: Recruitment</h1>

    <p>
        Sweat drips down the side of her head, breath heavy, but still she smiles. Not because she was happy. Raine was furious. But she smiles, because she loves her work. "Come on..." Muscles trained by her hard work tense up, as she pulls at the lever of the massive and loud machine she was working on. "Fuckin-... move!", she swears. She had improved this machine herself, designed to dry the plasteel components for her factory even more efficiently. But now someone stole her assigned android. At least that was her guess. It could've ran away for all she knows. Away from its never ending task of operating this machine day and night. She wouldn't even be mad. Although they have no feelings whatsoever, she couldn't help but always feel sorry for them. But now, she was cursing them out. 
        <br>
        "May I be of assistance, Miss Stark?" She turns her head. It didn't run away after all. "Charlie! About time! Please.", she stands, and gestures at the lever that she was unable to move. The android named Charlie kneels down, and yanks at it. Despite its robotic strength, the lever barely moved. "It appears to be stuck. Have you checked the pump's pressure?", Charlie suggests, but she was already on it, fingers accurately stabbing at the display above the Android. "Right... Try again." Charlie yanks at the lever again and it moves to its right position. She sighs. "Thank you, Charlie." The android stands before her. "Where were you, anyways?", she continues, taking off her gloves and opening her overall to release the wet heat on her skin. "I had to deviate from my assignment, when android C-4647 was malfunctioning. Doctor John ordered..." - "Of course.", she cuts the android off, and walks away. Charlie looks after her. "Continue your work on the dryer. No more deviating.", she calls, not looking back.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Dirty gloves smack down on a clean, white table, outlining them in black soot from the factory. The black man in his white coat, looks up from his display to find her soot smeared face. "I come back from my lunchbreak and see my plasteel dryer cooling down because no one operates it. Care to explain?" Doctor John's eyes carelessly lower down to his display again. "My android wasn't operating either.", he says with a deep raspy voice. "So your solution is to pull my android from its task and assign it to your shit? Why don't you get up from your chair, and do it yourself?", she hisses. "Because you are wearing the overall. Not me. And you did it before." - "Yeah! When I was engineering it! But now it is fully functional! A part of V-Steels factory! Like D-307 was before!" He glaces up again, wrinkles deepen on his forehead. "You done?"
        <br>
        She crosses her arms. "Not cool, John. Charl-... C-4650 is assigned to Dryer 308. Don't make me program him to tell you to fuck off." John chuckles at her warning. But before he could answer her, the door to his office slides open. A half bald man, wide shoulders covered by a fancy suit, walks in. Both of their heads turn to him. "Well that's a rare sight...", she murmurs, glancing at his emblem. She didn't know exactly, but she knew he was some high ranked animal in the list of bosses above them. "Mister Night.", Doctor John stands and walks around his table, ignoring his worker's rambling. "Welcome to our factory. Is there anything I can help you with?" - "Yes. I'm looking for... Miss Stark?" Doctor John turns towards her. She grabs her gloves, seeing how his eyes wander down to her belt, reading her glowing little work-ID. "You found her. How can I help you?" "You have visitors."
        <br>
        She frowns. "What? I didn't get a visit on my schedule this morning." - "Don't worry. It's the type of visitor that don't need an announcement. Trust me." Doctor John meet her eyes. "Follow me, please." Mister Night turns, and leaves John's office again. Before she could follow him out the door, John comes closer. "Hey...", he says, very quietly. "Mind if I tag along?" For him to even suggest that, proved her weird feelings to be justified. She nods slightly. Doctor John walks slightly behind them, as they traverse the factory towards the bureau's on the upper levels. "What's your function here?", Mister Night asks, eyeing her overall, of which the upper half was hanging down from her belt on her hips, leaving her covered only by her dark tanktop and black soot on her arms. "I am mainly a technician for the preparation and processing of the plasteel department. I have been busy with engineering lately, however." Mister Night looks at her again. "Are you qualified for that?" She could almost feel Doctor John hold his breath behind her. "Of course.", she lies. Mister Night sighs nervously, as if it was bad news for him. She notices. And she knows it would be rude to ask, so she does. "Is that a bad thing?" Mister Night does not answer.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Please.", Mister Night says, when they arrived in the bureau's of the factory, gesturing for her to step inside the room first. It was a clean room, only minimalistic decorations by the windows, near the table, where an older woman with strictly tied, ash-blonde hair was sitting in the shadow of her massive, armoured and armed bodyguard. "Ah, Miss Stark. Thank you for interrupting your work for us. I'm Marlise Hadron. Head of the Groundseekers recruitment office." Raine sits down in the single chair infront of her. "Hello.", she says, unsure. What would the Groundseekers want from her? An ordinary factory worker? "Before I tell you what this is all about, we need to verify your identity. Do you have your ID on you?" Raine detaches her worker-ID from her belt and puts it on her table, when the big man behind Marlise Hadron starts to move towards her. "Unfortunately, this wont suffice." Hadron continues, as the big man lifts her ID and lets it fall again, to take out a long cable from the display that was hidden in his armor, at the inside of his lower left arm. "If you don't mind.", she adds, with a poisonous nice smile. She nods. The big man inserts his cable into her neuro-link pocket behind her ear. In her inner eye, Raine watches him run through her identity values, before a security warning interrupts him when he wanted to know more. Birth certificate, mother and father, medical values and so on. She lets him enter, altough hesitantly. "Y'know, I am not required to give you any of this information." Hadron smiles again. "You're right. And we don't really need you to. It's just the easier way." - "For you." Rain adds. Hadron ignores her. When the big man was finished, Raine asks. "So... You happy?" Hadron looks at him for confirmation, who nods once. "Yes. And I am formally apologising for this rude violation of your privacy. We needed to be sure that you are the daughter of Joel Stark." Now, Raine sits up. Her eyes tell Hadron that she was forgiven. "You know him?" - "Yes." Raines eyes flicker around. Her brain quickly put two and two together. Groundseekers are commanding the Peacekeeping Force. Her father, who had lived a hundred lives before her, thanks to his Defyer type contract. Before she could say anything Hadron speaks. "My condolences."
        <br>
        <br>
        Raine exhales. All four people inside the room give her a minute, to let the news sink in. "But... How? Wasn't he..." Hadron interrupts her. "No offense, Miss Stark, but who is this man to you?", glancing through her, back to Doctor John. Raine's head turns around to him. "If he's a mere Employer, I feel obligated to tell you that we will be discussing very private matters." - "I don't mind.", Raine says, giving John a small smile. "Not only private to you, I might add. But also, to us." Now, she looks back at Hadron. "Can you give us a minute?" Hadron nods and watches her and John leave the room.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Raine. They're PKF. You know what happens when PKF visits you? And them telling you your Father died? They're here to..." - "I know.", Raine says, before he could finish. "Let me just see what they want, ok?" Doctor John streches his neck. "That's a bad idea..." He then looks at her and he knows there was nothing he could say anymore to change her mind. "Right. I'll be in my office, then." She watches him walk away. Then, she turns back to the door.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Are you alright, Miss Stark?" - "Thank you.", she sits back down. "So. How can it be, that my father is dead? Last I heard of him he was in the Greyan System. That was when I was twelve." Hadron nods. "Unfortunately, we have made many losses in said system. I'm afraid I cannot tell you more than that, for now, we had to pull back our forces until we have recovered our strength. But we will not give up on that system yet. That being said. Your fathers Defyer Space Craft has been destroyed. Therefore loosing all of his Defyer Data." Raine's eyes narrow. "You're here to find a new Defyer.", Raine concludes. Hadron lowers her head and closes her eyes in confirmation. "But why me? I'm sure there are a thousand guys out there more fitting for this task..." - "Before I can explain any further, would you sign this agreement, please? Any information I will give you from this point forwards is highly confidential. And even though I doubt it, I need you to give us promise to keep that information to yourself, should you decide to decline our offer." Raine looks at Hadron for a long while, before doing something she wouldn't have done ever, for the second time today. When she signed the confidentiality agreement, Hadron continues. "You are absolutely right. We would rather invest our expensive resources that are needed to create a Defyer on a male, for obvious reasons. The Defyer technology however is not perfect. What most people don't know about it, is that it unfortunately only works if we're given a very specific set in human DNA, for us to fully establish the Defyer technology onto the Space Craft. I wont bother you with the exact details. Suffice to say, we are still very limited to who we are able to choose for our Defyer program." Raine's eyebrows furrow as she soaks in the information she is given. Her father became a Defyer more than a hundred years before he met her mother. Has lived hundreds, if not thousands of lives, most of the times ending them in battle against the machines, as they call them. Or the Mantis, on the other side of our galaxy. Just to be reuploaded into a new body on his own Defyer Space Craft, to be then redeployed over and over again. If they need a very specific set of DNA for a Defyer Space Craft to even do what its supposed to do, cloning her body over and over... "You are here because you think, my DNA will work. You want me to step in my fathers shoes?", Raine concludes. "Exactly. There is still a small chance that your DNA wont work after all. But our first step after hearing of Captain Stark's unfortunate passing was to look for his descendants. You are his first born, next would be your younger brother." An anxious feeling overwhelms Raine when this woman only mentioned her family. "But with his 16 years of age, he is barely not old enough for us to legally recruit him. And I have a feeling that you wouldn't want this life for him anyways." The poisenous smile appears again. Raine looks at her angrily. "Oh, please don't give me that look. I know why you are here on SIERRA-02, a planet so far away from your family, working a break-neck job. I empathize... I really do. I do the same for my family, after all. Seeing your family only once every four to five years is... hard.", for the first time today, she didn't sound like a robot, but a human with feelings. But Raine did not trust her. She could be lying straight to her face, for all she knows. "Huh... But am I not too old?", she asks, knowing they know her age by now. "We have recruited twenty-five year olds before. If your DNA is compatible, everything else will be up to you. How fit you are, how fast you learn, how much combat experience you can accumulate until your first deployment." Raine leans forward, ellbows on the massive desk between them. "That wont be a problem, then. So what's the catch? I need to hear the pros and cons." Hadron smiles. "I like you. No unnecessary smalltalk." She grabs something under the desk, and reveals a small device. She gives it a little shove, so it slides over the big table, until it comes to a stop, perfectly, at the middle. With her lower arm, which also has a display on it, only this one was embedded in her very flesh, she seemed to start it up. "Mister Night? Why don't you wait in your office for me, until I'm done with Miss Stark here?", she asks him, without looking up from her arm. Mister Night, who was standing at the door this whole time, moves. "But she hasn't decided..." - "Please.", Hadron asks again, tone slightly changing. Raine does not glance over to him. She only hears the door slide open, and close again.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Let's start with the cons, hm?" The small device on the desk starts glowing up until all those little particles it sprayed around start glowing brightly, allocating until it shows them a set of data and a picture of a body. "Let's say you start with the program. We will have your body modified. Defyer Set 2.5.6, the latest update to them, by the way, will require you to get the latest release of MedUp's Atmos lungs, which also have the effect of changing your bloodtype to G/H." Raine nods. That makes sense for her, since she will be exposed to different atmospheres on different planets. "Never heard of it.", she says. "Good. You shouldn't have." Hadron continues. "Besides that, we'll see in what shape your heart is, most guys needed an optimization there, but you certainly look fit enough. The standart treatment for females and some cardio should do it for you. Then, we have the emergency access to circulation, or hallelujah-port, as the military calls it." - "Definitely heard of that.", Raine says, as she sees the hologram zoom into the persons neck, where a part of skin from ear down to the collarbone will be inserted, for the stims they use to literally stay alive with otherwise life-threatening injuries. Hadron nods. "Standard aswell. And last but not least, the most important implant. The Defyer Backup Neurolink. The piece of technology we are almost more proud of, than the Defyer program itself. Almost. Here's the bad part; it will require you to sacrifice one of your eyes. Next to the about thirty percent chance of you dying from the extreme brain surgery you'll have to undergo." - "Excuse me?", Raine spits out. "Your left eye. To be precise. Our technology has not yet been able to record all you see, while at the same time record all you feel, learn and all the other thousands of datapoints that would get lost, would you loose your life and needed to be redeployed. That, preferably with your memories, or at least some of them, intact. But don't worry, we will be able to replicate your eye exactly as it is now. Except one little cosmetic detail that will apear around that specific eye." Raine sits back. "So .. let me get this straight. If I die as a Defyer... I get redeployed.. with all my memories intact? Of my death, for example?" - "Not quite all of them. There is... always a memory loss. Sometimes bigger, sometimes there is none at all. Mostly depending on the brutality of your death. We haven't been able to built a DBN that trustfully and accurately backups everything we need without fail. But its already more than ninety percent of Defyers had before you. Which was no backup at all." Raine thinks about that for a second. "Okay. I can live with that, I think. I haven't heard any bad news yet. Don't get me wrong but... John warned me about you guys. So please, lets get to the juicy stuff." Hadron turns the display, relocating the holograph to the Defyer Space Craft. "The DSC. A beautiful and unspeakably expensive piece of technology. Soon to be all yours.", she starts, as if she was introducing Raine to a movie of some sort. As if she had agreed already to her new life as a Defyer. Rain really didn't like it and almost felt like there was no real choice anymore. "Not only is building such a ship using many resources, but also keeping it afloat, so to say. Keep you afloat. So lets say you are deployed. And then you die. You will cost us a fortune, to be cloned, your data reuploaded into your brain and put you back into action. All that will happen preemptively, of course, minimizing the time your squad has to survive without you. But you see, all the material we use to build such a space craft is Groundseekers property. So is everything that is and will be produced by it. Be it weapons, any of the vast artillery you will have at the ready at any time, the androids operating it... Or the clones." Raine glances through the procetion of the massive space craft to her. "I will be your property.", she says, leaving all the make-up she was saying behind. Hadron nods ever so slightly. "Now, that is a big con.", Raine says quietly. "So tell me, why I should sell my soul?" Hadron huffs. "Well... All of the cons we have spoken about have one effect. What humanity was seeking for a very long time. Immortality. Or, at least the closest thing to it we have ever achieved sofar. You will get all those upgrades to your body for free, of course. Upgrades that would cost any normal citizen a fortune to undergo. Next to the extensive military training and insight to all our ways and operations, as you become part of our very elite. Besides that, and I bet this will interest you the most, your salary. We at Groundseekers know full well just how much you as a Defyer will have to sacrifice. For most, there is no salary in the world that could justify such a decision over their fate. So we have designed... the promise." Hadrons projection switches to a beautiful earth-like world. Clean road between beautiful houses, gardens, schools... A seemingly perfect world. "The promise is what we offer to ensure the Defyers get, what they ultimately seek. In your case, a comfortable life for your family. They will receive all this, on top of our full health care ensurance and free educational paths for each and every member, plus a big part of your very own salary, on top of yours, of course, to do with it as they please. Be it buy their favourite hobby, or go on vacation every month." Raine thinks back. When she was a small child, she had exactly this. Until they didn't anymore. "As long as I stay alive.", Raine adds, darkly. "It's a contract, Miss Stark. We can only do our part if you do yours." Raine nods. "Alright. Anything else?" - "You will be modified, then trained for a good time. After that, you will meet your squad. One that fits your personality and function, whatever you'll end up choosing. I don't wanna bluff or anything, but I have to mention that the PKF is very proud of its squad matching system. You will spend alot of time with them. You and your three other squad members will hopefully grow close like family. You'll spend almost an eternity together, after all." - "How generous.", Raine says, a bit unimpressed.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Right so... How long do I have to think this over?", she then asks. Hadron's smile appears again. "I am very sorry to tell you that you won't have any time at all. You decide here. Now." Raine couldn't say anything. Are they serious? "I have to add, before you say no, that not only have we recruited twenty-five year olds before, but also sixteen year olds. You have probably noticed the end of Mister Starks contract, when you had to move away from Healig-5. And you took your job... here. That was quite some time ago and now I have to admit, we are quite desperate to find a new Defyer. Like I said before. Your brother would be next on my list." Raine sighs loudly. She almost wanted to insult this woman. But then she remembered that she probably also just had to do her job. "How high is the salary?", Raine asks again. "How much are you making now?" - "About thirdteen-hundred units." Hadron laughs out loud. "Triple that, and we have the salary that your family gets. Yours will be much, much bigger." Raine nods. "Good. Any ensurance my family gets in case you kill me with that modification procedure I'll undergo?" - "We can certainly arrange that. It will only be based on your current job, however." - "That's fine. What about ensurance that you wont try to recruit my brother anyways?" Hadron stays silent, then inhales and exhales. "If you want that. Sure." - "Yes, I do. My brother will do an education of his choice in your promise package. He will not be recruited." - "I will organize that." Raine lifts her head. Her eyes wander past Hadron, past the big bodyguard behind her, out the special protection window, into the wastelands of SIERRA-02. The deep red rocks on the golden sands. The scorching sun above. There was no real choice. Raine does, what she had to do.
        <br>
        "When do we depart?", she then asks. Hadron smiles, this time, a genuine smile, as if she just won another paycheck. Which she probably had. "You'll get time until tomorrow midday SIERRA-02 time. Angus here will help you carry out your belongings. They will be send back to the Zant System, to your family. Where you'll go, you wont need anything. We'll provide. I will be busy handling out the shipment of your belongings, your contracts and the compensation for Mister Night in the meantime. If you have any questions at all, I will assign him to you until our departure tomorrow." Marlise Hadron packs up her holoprojector and stands, to walk around the table to Raine. She holds out her hand. "I am honored to welcome you to the PKF, Misses Stark. I'm very glad the daughter of such a renowned Defyer is joining us to defend humanities ever-growing worlds." Raine shakes her hands, her mind far away. Not yet realising her world is about to change, drastically. Hadron leaves the room, leaving her and the big man called Angus, alone.>
